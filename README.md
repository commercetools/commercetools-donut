commercetools Donut Store
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/commercetools-donut.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/commercetools/commercetools-donut)
[![Heroku](http://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=ct-donut-prod&style=flat&svg=1)](https://ct-donut-prod.herokuapp.com/)

This is not a real **donut** store. This is a _free template_ for subscription ecommerce sites and it's built on top of the APIs of [commercetools platform](http://commercetools.com), [Pactas](http://www.pactas.com) and [Paymill](https://www.paymill.com).

This template is based on the [SPHERE JVM SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk).
If you are looking for a regular web-shop template using the SPHERE JVM SDK, please have a look at [Sunrise](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-sunrise-java) instead.

## Live demo
Visit a live demo of SPHERE-DONUT store at [iwantdonuts.com](http://www.iwantdonuts.com).

## Getting started

### Set it up
- Install [Play 2.4.3](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/Installing).
- [Clone](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository) sphere-donut project from GitHub, or download it as [zip file](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-donut/archive/master.zip).
- Run `sbt run` command in root project directory.
- Open your browser and point it to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).

### Product import

There is a flag named `fixtures.import.enabled` in the configuration file `conf/application.conf`, which allows an initial import of the required JSON-based product model
into the commercetools-platform. After a successful initial import, this flag can be set to `false` to improve the startup time of the application.

If you don't perform an initial import, you have to provide the product model (see `conf/data`) in your platform project, or the application will raise a `ProductNotFoundException` on application startup.

### Configure it

- Point to [SPHERE Login](https://admin.sphere.io/login) or register a new account with [SPHERE Signup](https://admin.sphere.io/signup).
- Go to `Developers -> API Clients` to retrieve your project data.

- To use your SPHERE.IO project, modify `sphere.project`, `sphere.clientId` and `sphere.clientSecret` in `conf/application.conf`.
